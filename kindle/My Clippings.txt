To draw an analogy: a man’s suffering is similar to the behavior of gas. If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber. Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore the “size” of human suffering is absolutely relative.

An active life serves the purpose of giving man the opportunity to realize values in creative work, while a passive life of enjoyment affords him the opportunity to obtain fulfillment in experiencing beauty, art, or nature. But there is also purpose in that life which is almost barren of both creation and enjoyment and which admits of but one possibility of high moral behavior: namely, in man’s attitude to his existence, an existence restricted by external forces.

To invoke an analogy, consider a movie: it consists of thousands upon thousands of individual pictures, and each of them makes sense and carries a meaning, yet the meaning of the whole film cannot be seen before its last sequence is shown. However, we cannot understand the whole film without having first understood each of its components, each of the individual pictures. Isn’t it the same with life? Doesn’t the final meaning of life, too, reveal itself, if at all, only at its end, on the verge of death?

It is much easier after the event to sort the relevant from the irrelevant signals. After the event, of course, a signal is always crystal clear; we can now see what disaster it was signaling, since the disaster has occurred. But before the event it is obscure and pregnant with conflicting meanings. It comes to the observer embedded in an atmosphere of “noise,” i.e., in the company of all sorts of information that is useless and irrelevant for predicting the particular disaster.

Psychohistory had been the development of mental science, the final mathematicization thereof, rather, which had finally succeeded. Through the development of the mathematics necessary to understand the facts of neural physiology and the electrochemistry of the nervous system, which themselves had to be, had to be, traced down to nuclear forces, it first became possible to truly develop psychology. And through the generalization of psychological knowledge from the individual to the group, sociology was also mathematicized.

Bayes’s theorem begins and ends with a probabilistic expression of the likelihood of a real-world event. It does not require you to believe that the world is intrinsically uncertain. It was invented in the days when the regularity of Newton’s laws formed the dominant paradigm in science. It does require you to accept, however, that your subjective perceptions of the world are approximations of the truth.

Imagine, for instance, that someone passed a rule, in the U.S. stock market as it is currently configured, that required every stock market trade to be front-run by a firm called Scalpers Inc. Under this rule, each time you went to buy 1,000 shares of Microsoft, Scalpers Inc. would be informed, whereupon it would set off to buy 1,000 shares of Microsoft offered in the market and, without taking the risk of owning the stock for even an instant, sell it to you at a higher price. Scalpers Inc. is prohibited from taking the slightest market risk; when it buys, it has the seller firmly in hand; when it sells, it has the buyer in hand; and at the end of every trading day, it will have no position at all in the stock market. Scalpers Inc. trades for the sole purpose of interfering with trading that would have happened without it. In buying from every seller and selling to every buyer, it winds up: a) doubling the trades in the marketplace and b) being exactly 50 percent of that booming volume. It adds nothing to the market but at the same time might be mistaken for the central player in that market.

It is a doctrine that may always be privately true, unfortunately, for any particular group of producers considered in isolation—if they can make scarce the one thing they have to sell while keeping abundant all the things they have to buy. But it is a doctrine that is always publicly false. It can never be applied all around the circle. For its application would mean economic suicide.

THOSE WHO DESIRE to read further in economics should turn next to some work of intermediate length and difficulty. I know of no single volume in print today that completely meets this need, but there are several that together supply it. There is an excellent short book (126 pages) by Faustino Ballvè, Essentials of Economics (Irvington-on-Hudson, N.Y.: Foundation for Economic Education), which briefly summarizes principles and policies. A book that does that at somewhat greater length (327 pages) is Understanding the Dollar Crisis by Percy L. Greaves (Belmont, Mass.: Western Islands, 1973). Bettina Bien Greaves has assembled two volumes of readings on Free Market Economics (Foundation for Economic Education). The reader who aims at a thorough understanding, and feels prepared for it, should next read Human Action by Ludwig von Mises (Chicago: Contemporary Books, 1949, 1966, 907 pages). This book extended the logical unity and precision of economics beyond that of any previous work. A two-volume work written thirteen years after Human Action by a student of Mises is Murray N. Rothbard’s Man, Economy, and State (Mission, Kan.: Sheed, Andrews and McMeel, 1962, 987 pages). This contains much original and penetrating material; its exposition is admirably lucid; and its arrangement makes it in some respects more suitable for textbook use than Mises’ great work.

Neurons are just cells. There is no mystical force that makes individual nerve cells or collections of nerve cells behave in ways that differ from what they would normally do. Given this fact, we can now turn our attention to how we might implement the ability of brain cells to remember and predict—our cortical algorithm—in silicon.

Here, then, is the recipe for building intelligent machines. Start with a set of senses to extract patterns from the world. Our intelligent machine may have a set of senses that differ from a human’s, and may even “exist” in a world unlike our own (more on this later). So don’t assume that it has to have a set of eyeballs and a pair of ears. Next, attach to these senses a hierarchical memory system that works on the same principles as the cortex. We will then have to train the memory system much as we teach children. Over repetitive training sessions, our intelligent machine will build a model of its world as seen through its senses. There will be no need or opportunity for anyone to program in the rules of the world, databases, facts, or any of the high-level concepts that are the bane of artificial intelligence. The intelligent machine must learn via observation of its world, including input from an instructor when necessary. Once our intelligent machine has created a model of its world, it can then see analogies to past experiences, make predictions of future events, propose solutions to new problems, and make this knowledge available to us.

If we were dealing with a deterministic world –that is, a world stripped of randomness (the right-column world in Table 1-1 in the Prologue), and we knew with certainty that it were the case, things would be rather easy. The pattern of the series would reveal considerable and predictive information. You could tell with precision what would happen one day ahead, one year ahead, and perhaps even a decade ahead. We would not even need a statistician: a second rate engineer would do.

If one puts an infinite number of monkeys in front of (strongly built) typewriters, and lets them clap away, there is a certainty that one of them would come out with an exact version of the Iliad. Upon examination, this may be less interesting a concept than it appears at first: Such probability is ridiculously low. But let us carry the reasoning one step beyond. Now that we have found that hero among monkeys, would any reader invest his life’s savings on a bet that the monkey would write the Odyssey next? In this thought experiment, it is the second step that is interesting. How much can past performance (here the typing of the Iliad) be relevant in forecasting future performance? The same applies to any decision based on past performance, merely relying on the attributes of the past time series. Think about the monkey showing up at your door with his impressive past performance. Hey, he wrote the Iliad. The major problem with inference in general is that those whose profession is to derive conclusions from data often fall into the trap faster and more confidently than others. The more data we have, the more likely we are to drown in it. For common wisdom among people with a budding knowledge of probability laws is to base their decision making on the following principle: It is very unlikely for someone to perform considerably well in a consistent fashion without his doing something right. Track records therefore become preeminent. They call on the rule of the likelihood of such a successful run and tell themselves that if someone performed better than the rest in the past then there is a great chance of his performing better than the crowd in the future—and a very great one at that. But, as usual, beware the middlebrow: A small knowledge of probability can lead to worse results than no knowledge at all.

When the statistician looks at the data to test a given relationship, say, to ferret out the correlation between the occurrence of a given event, like a political announcement, and stock market volatility, odds are that the results can be taken seriously. But when one throws the computer at data, looking for just about any relationship, it is certain that a spurious connection will emerge, such as the fate of the stock market being linked to the length of women’s skirts. And just like the birthday coincidences, it will amaze people.

Greatness is a transitory experience. It is never consistent. It depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind. The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man.

What has gone wrong with the development of economics as a science? Answer: There was a bunch of intelligent people who felt compelled to use mathematics just to tell themselves that they were rigorous in their thinking, that theirs was a science. Someone in a great rush decided to introduce mathematical modeling techniques (culprits: Leon Walras, Gerard Debreu, Paul Samuelson) without considering the fact that either the class of mathematics they were using was too restrictive for the class of problems they were dealing with, or that perhaps they should be aware that the precision of the language of mathematics could lead people to believe that they had solutions when in fact they had none (recall Popper and the costs of taking science too seriously). Indeed the mathematics they dealt with did not work in the real world, possibly because we needed richer classes of processes—and they refused to accept the fact that no mathematics at all was probably better.

There is in all things a pattern that is part of our universe. It has symmetry, elegance, and grace—those qualities you find always in that which the true artist captures. You can find it in the turning of the seasons, in the way sand trails along a ridge, in the branch clusters of the creosote bush or the pattern of its leaves. We try to copy these patterns in our lives and our society, seeking the rhythms, the dances, the forms that comfort. Yet, it is possible to see peril in the finding of ultimate perfection. It is clear that the ultimate pattern contains its own fixity. In such perfection, all things move toward death.

The heart of the problem, Mathisson explained, was that fast-moving robot trading machines were front-running long-term investors on exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market. For instance, if Fidelity wanted to buy a million shares of IBM, the Bots could detect the order and start buying IBM themselves, in the process driving up the price and making IBM more expensive. If Fidelity wanted to sell a million shares of IBM, the Bots would also sell, pushing the price down and causing Fidelity to sell on the cheap. To escape, the victims of the front running were turning to dark pools.

Computer programmers designed hunter-seeker algorithms that could detect, like radar, which way the market was going. The big game in this hunt became known as a whale—an order from a leviathan fund company such as Fidelity, Vanguard, or Legg Mason. If the algos could detect the whales, they could then have a very good sense for whether a stock was going to rise or fall in the next few minutes or even seconds. They could either trade ahead of it or get out of its way. The bottom line: Mom and Pop’s retirement accounts were full of mutual funds handing over billions of dollars a year to the Bots.

The result: Island was a pool full of sharks devouring one another. Andresen’s solution was a harbinger of important changes in the market to come in the next decade. Island would no longer simply court the savviest investors—the sharks, the cheetah-fast hedge funds. It would start going after what on Wall Street is known as dumb money. In other words, retail investors. That meant clients of E*Trade, Charles Schwab, Ameritrade—and even Interactive Brokers. Day traders or mom-and-pop investors who, more often than not, placed relatively unsophisticated orders into the market that the computer aces gobbled up.

It all went back to the “cost of ignorance” problem Levine had grappled with, which eventually led to his creation of maker-taker. Market makers often didn’t know who was on the other side of their trade, whether it was a tipped-off hedge fund manager who knew a stock was about to rocket higher (or plunge) or a dumb-as-dirt day trader making a reckless gamble. Because of that ignorance, market makers often would only buy the stock at a low price, or sell at a high price, in order to protect themselves.

Of course, the frenetic trading sparked by such strategies served zero purpose for investors. The mania around WorldCom showed how the market was evolving into a giant electronic slot machine for high-speed traders plugging it for dollars … millions of dollars. Maker-taker was becoming algorithmic steroids for high-speed firms, pumping them full of a steady flow of income for posting orders (while collecting fees from firms that had to trade, such as hedge funds and mutual funds). And all that high-frequency liquidity wasn’t going into stocks to simply “make markets,” as its practitioners claimed. It was methodically hunting down every last hole in the market’s plumbing to make a very fast buck.

While institutional traders were running from the lit markets such as Nasdaq into dark pools, in order to get away from the new breed of high-speed traders, like Tradebot, the speed traders devised methods to swim in the dark as well. Known as “latency arbitrage,” the strategy involved gaming the difference between the price of a stock in a dark pool and its price in the lit markets. Tradebot was effectively exploiting the “latency” of the system, a measurement of the time it takes for information to move from place to place in a closed system, such as a market.

“We created all these different order types to accommodate how they wanted to trade,” recalls one former Archipelago employee. “We tweaked how the order would interact with our book according to what they wanted. A lot of the unique orders were created at the request of a customer, typically a high-frequency customer. You had to be a sophisticated customer to learn how to use it. They’d send it in and we’d respond. It was a happy little circle.”

As Saluzzi and Arnuk repeatedly argued, the market was extremely unstable because high-frequency traders were likely to cut and run in a market shock, making the shock worse. “The last fifteen years … have seen the rise of new classes of very profitable, aggressive, and technologically savvy participants previously unknown in the U.S. markets,” Leuchtkafer wrote. “When markets are in equilibrium these new participants increase available liquidity and tighten spreads. When markets face liquidity demands these new participants increase spreads and price volatility and savage investor confidence. These participants can be more destructive to the interests of long-term investors than most have imagined.”

And while spreads were narrower, the narrowing was something of an illusion. In the late 1990s, when spreads were typically about twelve-and-a-half cents wide, the amount of stock a market maker would buy or sell in a single trade tended to be in the thousands of shares. Now the amount was typically one hundred or two hundred shares. An investor who wanted to buy, say, thirty thousand shares (a relatively small order for an institution) could easily pay fifty cents or more above the initial offer. The reason? High-speed Bots were bidding up the price, sensing a whale in the ocean.

Admittedly, the human traders and market makers the Bots had replaced had no one to blame but themselves. Nasdaq had been a nest of corruption, of scheming dealers colluding to enrich themselves at the expense of everyday investors. NYSE specialists had also been caught with their hands in the cookie jar. Good old-fashioned corruption and all-too-human greed had helped destroy a system that had lasted for centuries. But were the Bots better?

He cleared his throat, adjusted his glasses, and launched into his speech. “An exchange used to be a place, yes, a physical place, where people would come together to buy or sell, hoping to achieve the best price for themselves,” he said. “The more the exchange was able to attract all of the buy and sell interests in a product, the more the prices on the exchange would reflect the true state of supply and demand.” It was the old mantra: Liquidity breeds liquidity. But something had changed. “In the last twenty years came computers, electronic communications, electronic exchanges, dark pools, flash orders, multiple exchanges, alternative trading venues, direct access brokers, OTC derivatives, high-frequency traders … Reg NMS in the U.S.—and what we have today is a complete mess.” He looked out at the crowd. Dead silence. Peterffy hadn’t bothered to warm the audience up with a joke, a humorous anecdote. He cut straight to the point—and most of the people in the room didn’t like what he was saying. “It is not so much anymore that the public does not trust their brokers. They do not trust the markets, the exchanges, or the regulators either. And why should they, given our showing the past few years? To the public the financial markets may increasingly seem like a casino, except that the casino is more transparent and simpler to understand.” Visible tension spread through the room. Did Thomas Peterffy just call the market a casino? That was an attack they might have expected from the likes of Arnuk and Saluzzi or Senator Ted Kaufman—but from the founder of Timber Hill and Interactive Brokers, one of the godfathers of electronic trading? Peterffy, of course, was fully aware that his words seemed to contradict his own history. Like Josh Levine, he had believed that computers would revolutionize markets. And they had. But something had gone wrong. “I must confess to you that I was an ardent proponent of bringing technology to trading and brokerage. Unfortunately, I only saw the good sides. I saw how electronic trading and record-keeping could be used to force people to be more honest, to make the process more efficient, to lower transaction costs and to bring liquidity to the markets. I did not see the forces of fragmentation and the opportunity for people to use technology to keep to the letter but avoid the spirit of the rules—creating the current crisis.” He gazed out at his audience. Peterffy wasn’t shocked to see the stern faces, the shaking heads and averted eyes. He was certain that he’d become their enemy—and he had little hope that they would listen. The computer-trading elite would never admit that the markets they’d created were deeply flawed. Still, he kept hammering away. “It is vitally important that we bring an end to this crisis of trust before it spreads any further. That we bring back order, fair dealing, and trust in the marketplace. The financial markets of … the world’s developed countries are at a turning point. Technology, market structure, and new products have evolved more quickly than our capacity to understand or control them. The result has been a series of crises over the past few years that have caused many investors to lose confidence or to think that the whole system is a rigged game.” After Peterffy finished speaking, there was silence. Then a scattered handclap. And then the room burst into loud applause. Everyone realized: Peterffy had actually done it—he’d come out and said what so many were thinking, what they all knew deep down. The market was a complete mess. And the old guy was the only one with the balls to stand up there and call a spade a spade. It was a message Dan Mathisson at Credit Suisse would echo a few months later in his speech at the Fontainbleau Hotel in Miami Beach. Soon after the speech, Peterffy was hobnobbing with the titans of the exchange world. He ran into Sandy Frucher, vice chairman of Nasdaq and longtime chief of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. “How are you, Sandy?” Peterffy said. “I’m well,” said Frucher, a gray-haired veteran of the exchange wars. “But I don’t wake up in the morning thinking about which windmill to attack.” Peterffy understood exactly what Frucher was saying. In an ideal world, everyone would start behaving himself and stop focusing on the short-term buck, the quick hit. We all know the truth. You know. I know. This is Wall Street. You’re not changing a goddamn thing.

Kinetic was discovering that trading was far more complex than simply discovering signals in the market. Firms had to carefully measure their impact on specific stocks—whether their buy and sell orders were pushing prices around. This could be especially problematic for the small stocks Kinetic was trading, since few other firms were buying them on a regular basis. An order to buy a few thousand shares of Stanley Furniture could cause the stock to jump quickly (the reason: other AI Bots with order-detection systems on the lookout for whales). If Kinetic kept buying as the stock shot higher, the trade could easily end up a loser.

According to an academic study by a finance professor at the University of Illinois, by the late 2000s profits on rapid trading of Nasdaq stocks had turned negative, when accounting only for the spread between buy and sell prices. That meant the only way certain high-frequency firms—such as the scalper variety that profited on the difference between bids and offers—could make money was through maker-taker rebates, the fees they collected when other firms had to trade with them. The trouble for the exchanges: Everyone wanted to pocket the rebates. Every reasonably sophisticated firm, including Trading Machines, was putting orders into the market designed to earn the rebate. That posed a conundrum for the exchanges, Bodek theorized, because everyone couldn’t get the rebate. Everyone couldn’t win, because for every winner there had to be a loser. It was a zero-sum game—simple math.

And so, Bodek reasoned, a complex system was designed to pick winners and losers. It was done through speed and exotic order types. If you didn’t know which orders to use, and when to use them, you lost nearly every time. Which is exactly what happened to Trading Machines. Worse, if you weren’t getting the rebate, you were paying the fee. For a high-volume operator, the difference could mean a loss of tens of thousands of dollars a day.

Hebb’s rule, as it has come to be known, is the cornerstone of connectionism. Indeed, the field derives its name from the belief that knowledge is stored in the connections between neurons. Donald Hebb, a Canadian psychologist, stated it this way in his 1949 book The Organization of Behavior: “When an axon of cell A is near enough cell B and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A’s efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased.” It’s often paraphrased as “Neurons that fire together wire together.”

Computers do everything one small step at a time, like adding two numbers or flipping a switch, and as a result they need a lot of steps to accomplish anything useful; but those steps can be very fast, because transistors can switch on and off billions of times per second. In contrast, brains can perform a large number of computations in parallel, with billions of neurons working at the same time; but each of those computations is slow, because neurons can fire at best a thousand times per second.

A bigger problem is that, surprisingly, having more attributes can be harmful even when they’re all relevant. You’d think that more information is always better—isn’t that the motto of our age? But as the number of dimensions goes up, the number of training examples you need to locate the concept’s frontiers goes up exponentially. With twenty Boolean attributes, there are roughly a million different possible examples. With twenty-one, there are two million, and a corresponding number of ways the frontier could wind between them. Every extra attribute makes the learning problem twice as hard, and that’s just with Boolean attributes. If the attribute is highly informative, the benefit of adding it may exceed the cost. But if you have only weakly informative attributes, like the words in an e-mail or the pixels in an image, you’re probably in trouble, even though collectively they may have enough information to predict what you want.

There’s a gaping hole in the center of the puzzle, making it hard to see the pattern. The problem is that all the learners we’ve seen so far need a teacher to tell them the right answer.

In Isaac Asimov’s Foundation, the scientist Hari Seldon manages to mathematically predict the future of humanity and thereby save it from decadence. Paul Krugman, among others, has confessed that this seductive dream was what made him become an economist. According to Seldon, people are like molecules in a gas, and the law of large numbers ensures that even if individuals are unpredictable, whole societies aren’t. Relational learning reveals why this is not the case. If people were independent, each making decisions in isolation, societies would indeed be predictable, because all those random decisions would add up to a fairly constant average. But when people interact, larger assemblies can be less predictable than smaller ones, not more. If confidence and fear are contagious, each will dominate for a while, but every now and then an entire society will swing from one to the other. It’s not all bad news, though. If we can measure how strongly people influence each other, we can estimate how long it will be before a swing occurs, even if it’s the first one—another way in which black swans are not necessarily unpredictable.

Of course, even if you use Alchemy with no initial formulas (and you can), that doesn’t make it knowledge-free. The choice of formal language, score function, and optimizer implicitly encodes assumptions about the world. So it’s natural to ask whether we can have an even more general learner than Alchemy. What did evolution assume when it began its long journey from the first bacteria to all the life-forms around today?

Science now tells us, love yourself above everyone else, for everything in the world relies on self-interest. You love yourself and manage your own affairs properly and your coat remains whole. Economic truth adds that the better private affairs are organized in society—the more whole coats, so to speak—the firmer its foundations and the better organized common welfare shall be. Therefore, in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for myself, I am acquiring, so to speak, for everyone, and helping to get my neighbor a little more than a torn coat; and that is not because of my private, personal liberality, but because of a general advance. The idea is simple, but unhappily it has been a long time reaching us because we have been hindered by idealism and sentimentality. And yet very little intelligence is needed to perceive it . . . ”

The first category, generally speaking, contains men who are conservative in temperament and law-abiding; they live under control and love to be controlled. To my thinking it is their duty to be controlled, because that’s their vocation, and there is nothing humiliating in it for them. The second category transgresses the law; they are destroyers or disposed to destruction according to their capacities. The crimes of these men are of course relative and varied; for the most part they seek in very varied ways the destruction of the present for the sake of the better.

The vast mass of mankind is mere material, and only exists in order by some great effort, by some mysterious process, by some crossing of races and stocks, to bring into the world at last perhaps one man out of a thousand with a spark of independence. One in ten thousand perhaps—I speak roughly, approximately—is born with some independence, and with still greater independence one in a hundred thousand. The man of genius is one of millions, and the great geniuses, the crown of humanity, appear on earth perhaps one in many thousand millions. In fact I have not peeped into the retort in which all this takes place. But there certainly is and must be a definite law, it cannot be a matter of chance.”

Yes, that’s true. That’s the law of their nature, Sonia . . . that’s true! . . . And I know now, Sonia, that whoever is strong in mind and spirit will have power over them. Anyone who is very daring is right in their eyes. He who despises most things will be a lawgiver among them and he who dares most of all will be most in the right! That’s how it has been until now and that’s how it will always be.

The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent.

The aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable. The aim of the High is to remain where they are. The aim of the Middle is to change places with the High. The aim of the Low, when they have an aim—for it is an abiding characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily lives—is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal. Thus throughout history a struggle which is the same in its main outlines recurs over and over again.

And if any entity, anywhere in the universe, happens to have the property of being good at making more copies of itself, then automatically more and more copies of that entity will obviously come into existence. Not only that but, since they automatically form lineages and are occasionally miscopied, later versions tend to be ‘better’ at making copies of themselves than earlier versions, because of the powerful processes of cumulative selection. It is all utterly simple and automatic.

Cumulative selection is the key to all our modern explanations of life. It strings a series of acceptably lucky events (random mutations) together in a nonrandom sequence so that, at the end of the sequence, the finished product carries the illusion of being very very lucky indeed, far too improbable to have come about by chance alone, even given a timespan millions of times longer than the age of the universe so far.

By law, nobody can trade at a higher price until every single offer in the market at the lower price is gone. The only way to get rid of somebody else’s lower offers is to buy them up.

It’s extremely difficult to front-run in our modern markets. Every would-be explanation of front-running relies on some imagined method for divining the mere existence of a customer order, and Lewis doesn’t even try to explain how somebody figures out the number of shares in the order – the one piece of information that is actually needed to make the scam plausible. Even with that information, the economics would be entirely skewed against the front-runner due to the markets’ rules on the price and prioritization of trades. Lastly, today’s markets are made up of a huge, diverse set of participants. It’s absurd to think that a predictable front-running scheme wouldn’t either be easily avoided, or be a target itself. Any front-running scam would have to overcome each and every one of these obstacles to succeed – and then, it would have to evade a massive surveillance system built to track every piece of trading data available.

In the eyes of Algazel, a skeptic fideist (i.e., a skeptic with religious faith), knowledge was not in the hands of humans, but in those of God, while Adam Smith calls it the law of the market and some modern theorist presents it as self-organization. If the reader wonders why fideism is epistemologically equivalent to pure skepticism about human knowledge and embracing the hidden logics of things, just replace God with nature, fate, the Invisible, Opaque, and Inaccessible, and you mostly get the same result. The logic of things stands outside of us (in the hands of God or natural or spontaneous forces); and given that nobody these days is in direct communication with God, even in Texas, there is little difference between God and opacity. Not a single individual has a clue about the general process, and that is central.

(i) Look for optionality; in fact, rank things according to optionality, (ii) preferably with open-ended, not closed-ended, payoffs; (iii) Do not invest in business plans but in people, so look for someone capable of changing six or seven times over his career, or more (an idea that is part of the modus operandi of the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen); one gets immunity from the backfit narratives of the business plan by investing in people. It is simply more robust to do so; (iv) Make sure you are barbelled, whatever that means in your business.

Someone with a linear payoff needs to be right more than 50 percent of the time. Someone with a convex payoff, much less. The hidden benefit of antifragility is that you can guess worse than random and still end up outperforming. Here lies the power of optionality—your function of something is very convex, so you can be wrong and still do fine—the more uncertainty, the better.

Let me summarize the argument: if you have favorable asymmetries, or positive convexity, options being a special case, then in the long run you will do reasonably well, outperforming the average in the presence of uncertainty. The more uncertainty, the more role for optionality to kick in, and the more you will outperform. This property is very central to life.

To see how transfer of antifragility works, consider two scenarios, in which the market does the same thing on average but following different paths. Path 1: market goes up 50 percent, then goes back down to erase all gains. Path 2: market does not move at all. Visibly Path 1, the more volatile, is more profitable to the managers, who can cash in their stock options. So the more jagged the route, the better it is for them. And of course society—here the retirees—has the exact opposite payoff since they finance bankers and chief executives. Retirees get less upside than downside. Society pays for the losses of the bankers, but gets no bonuses from them. If you don’t see this transfer of antifragility as theft, you certainly have a problem.
